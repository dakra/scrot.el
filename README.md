# Simple screenshot utility for Emacs

Take screenshots with scrot (or tool specified in `scrot-command`),
upload them to imgbb and copy the url to the kill-ring.

## Usage

Just call `M-x scrot`, select your filename (which is pre-filled
with a few suggestions. use `M-n` to select different ones)
and then select the region you want a screenshot of.
